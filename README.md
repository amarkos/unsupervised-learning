## Name of instructor
Angelos Markos, Democritus University of Thrace, Greece.

## Short description
This course delves into advanced topics in cluster analysis, focusing on
on both classical clustering methods and modern techniques from an
application-oriented perspective. It aims to equip students with the skills
to critically evaluate different clustering algorithms, to interpret and
utilize a range of (dis)similarity measures, and to identify the challenges
and considerations in clustering categorical and mixed-type data.
Through a blend of theory and practice, the course will explore
algorithmic nuances, performance metrics, and real-world applications,
empowering students to make data-driven decisions.

## Schedule
1. Beyond partitioning and hierarchical methods
2. Interpreting and applying appropriate dis(similarity) measures for
categorical data
3. Challenges in clustering mixed-type data
4. Aspects of cluster validity
